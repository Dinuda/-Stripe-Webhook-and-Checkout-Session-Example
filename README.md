# Stripe Webhook and Checkout Session Example
This is an example implementation of Stripe's webhook and checkout session functionality using Node.js and the Stripe API. The purpose of this implementation is to provide a starting point for developers looking to implement these features in their own projects.

## Getting Started
To get started with this implementation, you will need to have the following:

- A Stripe account
- Node.js installed on your machine
- A basic understanding of Node.js and the Stripe API
  
Once you have these prerequisites, follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code

1. Install dependencies by running npm install

1. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Stripe test secret key and webhook secret key as environment variables. For example:

```
SECRET_TEST_KEY=your_test_secret_key
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_key

```

4. Replace `CUSTOMER_ID` and `PRICE_ID` with the respective IDs from your Stripe account.


5. Update the success and cancel URLs in the app.post('/stripe/checkout-session') endpoint to match your own website or application.

## Usage
To run the application, use the command npm start or node app.js.

Once the server is running, you can test the functionality of the webhook and checkout session by doing the following:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser

1. Click the "Subscribe" button to initiate the checkout session

1. Use the session_url returned in the browser object to navigate to the checkout page
   
1. Enter test payment information and complete the checkout process

1. Observe the console output to see the results of the webhook events


### Next Steps

This implementation provides a basic starting point for using Stripe's webhook and checkout session functionality. Developers can use this code as a basis for further customization and integration into their own projects.

Some potential next steps for customization include:

Implementing logic to handle different webhook events and perform different actions based on the event type
Styling the checkout page to match the look and feel of your own website or application
Using Stripe's API to retrieve and display information about subscriptions and customers in your application.
